  <h1>College Goals</h1>
  <p>Now that I am in college my goals have shifted gears a little bit. I am entering my 4th year wrestling at Wisconsin and my goal is to be a National Champion. This goal may sound lofty I know, but I am willing to put in the work to get there. College is different than high school, you don't just wrestle one or two good guys per year and beat up on everyone else that you wrestle against. In college, every single match is tough in every kid is good. That was the biggest difference that I immediately noticed when coming into the practice room. I was used to being the best guy in my state. But coming into the wrestling room here, I wasn't even the best guy on the team. And coming in every day and getting my butt kicked my freshman year was humbling to say the least. Now that I am a senior, I have a few years of college wrestling under my belt, and my goals have shifted. I have another year of eligibility left after this season and my goal is still to be a national champion, but I also know that I must take baby steps in order for this to get done. I need to become an NCAA qualifier, then an All American, and then finally national champion. In high school, I would look over my goals a little too far out, but in college I have to put one foot in front of the other and accomplish the next thing that's in front of me. So as of right now, the goal is to make the starting lineup this year and then try to wrestle to the best of my abilities, and when the Big 10 championships come around, I need to win a couple matches and qualify for the national tournament.</p>
